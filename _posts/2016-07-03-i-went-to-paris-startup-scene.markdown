Thanks to a complicated series of events and (possibly) mistaken identity, I found myself in Paris this week for three days. A large global bank were under the false impression that I could help fix their doomed business models and funded the entire trip.

I went to [Viva Technology ](http://www.vivatechnologyparis.com/)— which has usurped the now defunct [Le Web](http://leweb.co/) conference as the biggest in France.

I did a **ton** of cool stuff, including;

* eating at the [#1 cereal cafe](https://twitter.com/cerealisteparis) in all of Paris,

* listening to talks from Eric Schmidt and DeepMind’s founder [Demis Hassabis](https://twitter.com/demishassabis),

* meeting the Google [self-driving car](https://www.instagram.com/p/BHRbZsmA3R4/),

* having my mind melted by the [new Oculus Rift](https://twitter.com/D4Software/status/748821488854118400),

* chatting to the always-affable [Mike Butcher](https://twitter.com/mikebutcher),

* watching [President Hollande](https://twitter.com/search?f=images&vertical=default&q=hollande%20vivatech&src=typd) nearly crash a drone,

* as well as obligatory touristy stuff like la Tour Eiffel and [Musee des arts et metiers](http://www.arts-et-metiers.net/)

It struck me that France has a bit of an inferiority complex when it comes to tech and startups. They *think* France is lagging behind (compared to London, Berlin, etc), but I saw a really vibrant tech scene on display — full of ideas and energy. They need to believe in themselves more.

However, by far the most interesting stuff happened away from the tech and with the real people I met.

Yes this is about the UK and the EU.

I made a **lot** of new friends and without exception the French were keen to talk about *le Brexit*. They were always good-natured, but every conversation was couched in a mood that can summed up as:
> “Oh wow, you Brits have **really** f**ked it up this time”

They tried to console me, but there was an almost-overwhelming sense of sadness in all our conversations — from both sides — and a kind of disbelief that this was actually happening. “Why do you want to leave us?”, they said.
> “Well, you are welcome in Paris any time!”
 — A nice French business man

The stereotypes about French (and particularly Parisian) rudeness are utter bullshit — everyone was really nice, kind and friendly — certainly more so than any tech event I’ve been to in London.

So, à bientôt Paris.

Let’s hope I don’t need a visa to get in next time.

For organizations mandating a return-to-office policy, this data serves as a crucial reminder. Companies that fail to offer flexibility may risk losing their most talented team members to competitors who provide a more balanced work-life experience.

As a software engineering leader: advocate for policies that align with these evolving preferences, ensuring your team remains motivated and committed to achieving strategic goals.

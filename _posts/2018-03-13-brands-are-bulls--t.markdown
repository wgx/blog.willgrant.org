I donâ€™t mean â€˜brandâ€™ in the sense of â€˜visual identityâ€™: a good logo, wordmark or tagline is a great idea. I mean â€˜brandâ€™ in the modern sense, a *wooly definition* thatâ€™s come to be commonplace over the past 10 years or so.

â€˜Brandâ€™ has come to allude to the company, or to stand for the entire personality of a corporation or product â€” the â€˜feelingâ€™ of interacting with their products and services, and inevitably the core interactions of those products.

The problem with this approach, developed for over a decade by multinational branding corporations, is that **we already have a discipline for this**: user experience.

By crafting a product to adhere to a brand (in the modern sense of the word) we defer control of the user experience to the marketing and branding teams, not user experience professionals.

Similarly, Iâ€™m not talking about the megabrands with a billion customers: Apple, Google, Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Nike, etc â€” these guys are so big and their brands so powerful it *does* and *should* make a difference to how their products are designed.

Your brand however, with a few thousand or tens of thousands of customersâ€¦ Your small company or product or newly-launched startupâ€¦

**Nobody cares.**

Harsh, but true. None of your users care about your brand. They care about what your product or service *lets them do.*

They care about how your product improves their lives, enhances their productivity, and so on. The experience of your product **is** your brand â€” and it shouldnâ€™t be designed by a marketing team, but by UX people.

This is also your competitive advantage against the big, lumbering dinosaurs who have to adhere rigidly to their brand guides.

Donâ€™t let the â€˜brand guideâ€™ ruin your product with;

* **Unreadable brand typefaces**: just use the native system font stack

* **Branded splash screens**: just show me the damn app

* **Build-your-own nightmarish UI controls: **oh, the things iâ€™ve seenâ€¦

* **Awful, unreadable contrast ratios** â€” donâ€™t stick to the brand palette if it doesnâ€™t work in your product

* **Unnecessarily quirky** copy, the â€˜wackyâ€™ humour on the side of a smoothie bottle

...and so on.

A brand can help enforce consistency, but if youâ€™re a decent designer you shouldnâ€™t need a brand guide to tell you how to build consistent user interfaces.

Brands are bullshit, focus on the user experience and the experience *becomes* the brand.

# We were number 1 on HN all day, hereâ€™s what happened

SQLizer is a database migration and conversion tool â€” it takes Excel, JSON or XML or CSV files and turns them into SQL databases (MySQL or MS SQL Server).

We wrote a blog post about SQL â€” the language â€” itself, how itâ€™s been around for over 40 years and how itâ€™s often (still) the best tool for the job.

From [the post](http://blog.sqlizer.io/posts/sql-43/):
> *The simple fact that both [RDBMS & SQL] arrived early in the life of computing, and that for 90% of the time they just work, means databases have become a â€˜solved problemâ€™ you no longer need to think about.*
> *Itâ€™s like how MailChimp has become synonymous with sending email newsletters. If you want to work with data you use RDBMS and SQL. In fact, there usually needs to be a good reason not to use them. Just like there needs to be a good reason not to use MailChimp for sending emails, or Stripe for taking card payments.*

Much to our surprise our post spent over** 6 hours** at [the top of Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14245354) â€” with **580 upvotes** and **377 comments**.

### Hereâ€™s the rest of the numbers for the blog post

Time we were #1 for **6.5hrs = 390 mins**
Unique users: **35,745**

**Operating systems**

Android **25.9%**
Windows **25.7%**
Mac **22%**
iOS **19%**
Linux **6.8%**

Special mention to the one valiant user on Xbox.

**Device split: 54% Desktop **to** 42% Mobile **(3% tablet)

Pageviews: **38,502**

### The long tail

The traffic held up well over the second day, and we served **over 64,000 page views** over 4 days.

![TIL: lots of people bookmark things to read later.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*g9Jprzgi74TdQ9Hg-LEY9A.png)*TIL: lots of people bookmark things to read later.*

### Meanwhile over at the product itself (SQLizer)

We saw a **400% uplift** in unique sessions over the normal traffic for a Tuesday, but not all of those users actually tried the product.

We only saw a **12% increase** in usage (people actually converting a file with SQLizer) over the normal levels.

Our assumption is, if you donâ€™t need to convert a file to SQL *right now*, then SQLizer is the kind of site you bookmark and come back to later. We werenâ€™t expecting a huge amount of increased usage.

Hopefully thereâ€™s now a few thousand more developers out there who will think of SQLizer next time they need to convert a file to SQL. ðŸ˜€

[*SQLizer](https://sqlizer.io/?utm_source=wgx) is the internetâ€™s leading database migration and conversion tool, itâ€™s free for files up to 5,000 rows and starts from $10 after that.*

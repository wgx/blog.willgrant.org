This is a complete #humblebrag but I’m ok with that (this is LinkedIn after all). 

My first book (from back in 2018) has been cited in over 50 academic papers. I just love the diversity of these titles:

🏠 Application of affordance factors for user-centered smart homes: a case study approach

🌇 Digital Arrival Infrastructures: Housing Platforms and Residency Governance in Berlin's Rental Sector

⚱️ Digital Cultural Items in Space: The Impact of Contextual Information on Presenting Digital Cultural Items

🩸 Usability of Mobile Application for Implementing Genetic Counselling Intervention among Thalassemia Patients and Caregivers

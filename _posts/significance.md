Significance

The [vision statement](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Vision) of the Wikimedia foundation (who run Wikipedia) is;
> *Imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. That’s our commitment.*

The sum of all knowledge, free, for every human.

Wikipedia have some scale challenges — they’re the fifth-most-visited property on the web — but [under the hood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wikimedia-servers-2010-12-28.svg) their technology is surprisingly ‘vanilla’ and comprised of widely-used open-source projects. They use a PHP-driven content system, MySQL databases and lots of caching.

Rather than the tech, it’s that **vision** that makes them the most significant product on the web.

The technical innovation that companies like Google and Twitter have achieved is staggering; Indexing all of the web’s content and making it searchable in milliseconds, for example, or operating a [global real-time communications network](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering).

Incredible technology from behemoths that were once tiny startups.

A USB memory stick isn’t cutting-edge technology, but the whole Korean-language Wikipedia is [just over 1Gb zipped](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download), and fits nicely on a memory stick which can be attached to a balloon and [sent over North Korea](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20445632), sailing over the firewall on the breeze. Wikipedia makes this kind of vital [information activism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_activist) possible.

**Sometimes it’s not the tech that makes the startup: it’s the vision.**

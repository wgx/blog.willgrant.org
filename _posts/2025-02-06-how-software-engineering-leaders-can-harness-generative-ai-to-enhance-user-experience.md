Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is transforming user experiences by enabling digital products to generate useful outputs from natural language prompts. As software engineering leaders, it's crucial to adapt to this shift and integrate Generative AI into your digital products. Here's how you can strategically approach this transformation.

#### Understanding the Impact

As GenAI becomes more prevalent, users will expect prompt-based interfaces across all software products. Failing to meet this expectation can lead to poor user satisfaction. GenAI automates tasks like user flows and prototype creation, increasing the demand for UX professionals skilled in creative thinking, behavioral science, and prompt design. However, this also raises concerns about biased or inaccurate outputs due to the opaque nature of AI models.

#### Actionable Recommendations

1. Redesign Software Experiences: Shift towards a prompt-based interaction model. Allow users to express their goals and constraints directly, simplifying their interaction with software.

2. Upskill Your Team: Invest in training for your UX teams to master prompt design and user research skills. Provide resources and time for upskilling to ensure they can effectively utilize GenAI tools.

3. Monitor AI Outputs: Implement continuous monitoring of AI-generated outputs to ensure they are copyright-compliant, inclusive, unbiased, and accessible. This will help address potential risks and maintain ethical standards.

4. Invest in User Research: Conduct regular user research to understand how new generative AI features are perceived. Use both qualitative and quantitative methods to ensure user needs are met.

5. Enhance Creativity with AI: Use GenAI to augment human creativity, not replace it. Encourage your teams to focus on higher-level creativity and decision-making, while AI handles repetitive tasks.

#### Strategic Planning

By 2028, more than 75% of end-user software is expected to feature prompt-based interfaces, a significant increase from around 10% in 2024. This shift requires software engineering leaders to prepare their teams to adapt their workflows, design interfaces, and implement policies for inclusive, ethical, and legal AI-enabled user experiences.

#### Conclusion

Generative AI is reshaping the landscape of user experience design. As a software engineering leader, it's essential to embrace this change by redesigning interfaces, upskilling teams, and ensuring ethical AI use. By doing so, you can enhance user satisfaction and maintain a competitive edge.

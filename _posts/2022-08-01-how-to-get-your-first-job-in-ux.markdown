I get asked this question a lot, so it seems like a good idea to collect my thoughts and turn it into a post - I aim to update this regularly as I think of new things.

I’ve done a lot of UX work over the past 20+ years, from freelance and contract, to startups and big enterprise companies. I’ve also seen _thousands_ of CVs (really) and hired over 100 people into design roles. Here’s my take on things...


## Background


### Why work in UX?

If you’re reading this, you’ve probably already decided you’d like to work in User Experience. If you’re still deciding, here’s some reasons why I think UX, Product Design, User Research and so on, are good careers to investigate.

**Impact**

If design is working well in your organisation, then designers can have a huge, direct impact on the products and services your organisation delivers. You can improve product capabilities, save people time, help them make better decisions, and generate more revenue for the company - all by employing thoughtful design at every stage of the product lifecycle. It’s a rewarding feeling when you see something you’ve designed being used (happily) by 100s or even 1000s of people.

**Human**

UX is by its nature a very human-centric field. You have to think about people a lot, empathise with their needs, interview people, and liaise with lots of people across your organisation on a daily basis. You don’t _have_ to be a “people person” to be a good UX designer, but if you’re at the other end of that spectrum and _really_ don’t like social interaction - UX might not be a great fit for you. 

**Remote-friendly**

Many jobs in the tech industry are remote-friendly like software engineering and customer support. UX lends itself to this mode of working really well - thanks to collaboration tools like Miro, Figma and video conferencing. I hope you like video calls, you’re going to be doing **a lot** of them. 


### Transition paths


Over the past few years I’ve worked with great UX people who’ve come from the following disciplines: marketing, visual design, product management, and even non-tech fields like medicine or bioscience. It’s a very broad field of work and that does make it accessible to lots of people. 


### Skills needed


Do I need a university degree? No. 

Would it help me stand out amongst other applicants? Probably, for some roles.

It really depends on the sector or industry you’re going into. 

For example: if you work in marketing for a fashion company, moving into UX on an online fashion store would be a great transition - and it’s unlikely a degree or masters’ in UX or [HCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction) would add much to your chances of getting hired.

Conversely - if you’re applying to work in UX on deeply technical software for database engineering, a Computer Science degree would make you a more desirable candidate to a recruiter. 


## Preparation


### Courses and bootcamps

A short online course in the basics of UX should be considered mandatory for anyone entering the field. In a good course you’ll learn basic HCI theory, practice the problem solving of “design thinking”, come up with user personas, draw wireframe designs, and so on. There’s probably a lot of “[snake oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_oil)” out there - courses that claim to skill you up to “master” level in a few days - but stick to the well known, well-rated courses and you’ll get a lot of value. I’ve hired a few people over the years who’ve done the [Coursera courses](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/interaction-design) and the work they’ve demonstrated as part of their coursework has been excellent. 


### Books

Here are some books that I’d consider essential for any newcomer to User Experience (note these are Amazon Affiliate links).

### Speculative projects

Speculative projects (often called “spec work” or similar) is where you _pretend_ to be working for a real paying client: but do all the work yourself for a portfolio piece. They’re great for a few reasons; first, they’re great practice. Setting yourself a challenge like “let’s redesign Instagram for the macOS desktop” or “Could I design an Uber for dog sitting” is a doorway to a whole heap of new ideas and exploration. You’ll flex those UX muscles and finish the process with a bit more practice under your belt.

Second: they can help bulk out a beginner’s portfolio - obviously the hiring manager will know you _didn’t actually_ work for Instagram, but you can demonstrate your process anyway.

Finally: they look great to recruiters and hiring managers. A spec project shows your work _and_ shows your interest in the field. Being curious and interested in product design is very attractive to hiring managers. 


## Getting hired

**Move internally**

If you’re in a big enough organisation, it might be possible to move internally across teams or departments and take on UX work. If a full move isn’t possible, maybe you can “act up” and perform some duties of a UX professional. All this work can be added to your portfolio and resume for a future external role. 

**Freelance work**

Why get a job at all? Freelance UX designers work directly for clients and deliver problem-solving design solutions. You find clients, understand their needs, deliver design work, present it back - and get paid. That’s the idea anyway (more on that later). 

There’s lots to like about the freelance (or short-term contract) life: you get to work for yourself, feeling in control of your own destiny - it can be rewarding. 

There are some downsides too: you need to be constantly searching for work, always thinking about the next gig. After a while, it feels like 80% of your job is sales, prospecting, client management (ie: please pay me!) - with a little bit of time left over to actually do design work. 

**How to get that first freelance client**

Look at existing customers - who have you worked for in the last 6 months or 12 months (in any capacity) - reach out to them: do they need any UX projects tackling?

Look for customers _like_ your existing/past customers - reach out to them: "Hey I did a project for X recently, looks like you're solving similar problems at Y".

Network - look at your network and approach them "I really like [your thing] - I’d love to help out with any UX design requirements you might have".

Then finally, you can try [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/), [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/), you could even try the gruelling [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/) signup & interview process.

It's a “numbers game”, send a lot of messages, hope that some stick. Remember: it's 100x easier to get work from a past client than to find a new one.


### Applying for jobs

So you’ve ticked all the boxes so far: 

1. Keen interest in UX, product design, user interface, or cognitive psychology
2. Completed a UX, research, interaction design course or similar
3. Built a portfolio from your coursework and some spec work
4. Read (or started to read) some classic UX books

…and it’s time to start applying for jobs. 

This _really_ is a “numbers game” - you have to apply to a lot of jobs, to get a few interviews, to get the one offer you want. Think of it like a [sales funnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchase_funnel). 

Don’t get fixated on one job, or one employer - it’ll be too disappointing if you don’t get _that one dream job_. There are plenty more jobs out there to apply for, you need to have thick skin, patience and determination. 

**Resume**

There are a million pages on the web about resume (CV) writing tips, so I won’t go into that in detail. Keep it short, readable, tastefully designed, focus on experience, skills, education. 

**The Interview (and Cover Letters)**

I’ve lumped these together because, in a way, you’re trying to demonstrate the same things to the hiring manager in both cases. The “big four” you’re demonstrating are: your **interest**, **experience**, **methodology**, and **commercial** **awareness**. 

The people interviewing you are asking themselves “is this person nice, decent, approachable **and** can they do the job?”.


* **Evidence of interest** - does this candidate have a genuine interest in UX, what have they done “[off their own bat](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/do-off-own-bat)”: internships, spec work, blog posts, online portfolio
* **Evidence of experience** - hard if you’re new to the sector, but put down anything you can think of: did you perform some related work in a previous role that you can mention?
* **Evidence of methodology** - do you understand a modern product design methodology, do you use one? How can you evidence this with examples? No experience? Fine: talk about what you learned on your course or university degree.
* **Evidence of commercial awareness**- design doesn’t operate in a vacuum. Do you understand the company, its products, competitors and market? Demonstrate you’ve done some basic background research.

**The “take home test”**

Increasingly common over recent years, these tests are designed to show the hiring team that you can indeed think like a designer, solve problems and evidence _why_ you made the choices you did in the design process. Usually you’ll be asked to spend a few hours on these tasks, and present them back to the hiring panel. 

I often advise more senior designers to avoid these tests and decline when asked to do them. They’re unnecessary - a hiring manager should be able to look at a seasoned designer’s portfolio of work, and with a couple of interviews, establish if they are a good fit or not. The time spent doing these tests could be better used applying to more jobs with companies that _don’t_ ask for a take home test.

However, if you’re just starting out, I’m afraid you’ll need to accept these “take home” tests. I’d advise not spending too much time on polishing them - when interviewing I care more about the thought process the designer went through rather than seeing a shiny finished product. 

Remember what you’re trying to demonstrate: **interest**, **experience**, **methodology** and **commercial** **awareness**. Cover all these points when presenting your work back to the interviewers. 

**Conclusion**

It’s hard, but it’s possible. You can move into UX with no experience, it takes a lot of determination and perseverance - but it can be done (I’ve seen many people do it over the years). 

Finally, if there’s anything you strongly disagree with in this post I’d love to hear about it. I’ll be revising this post as I think of new things or change my views over time.

Good luck!

"Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know." (Jakob Nielsen's Law of Internet User Experience)
 
Users transfer their expectations of one system across to other systems they use.
 
As generative AI-enabled features become more ubiquitous, users will naturally anticipate this functionality in your software as well.
 
In a recent survey conducted with software engineering teams (n=86), we asked if they were planning to pre-emptively integrate AI-powered features into their software. The results were quite revealing. Over half - 52% - of the respondents, reported they had no such plans.
 
When we segmented the data based on the size of the organizations, a clear pattern emerged:
 
Large organizations with over 10,000 employees were 5 times more likely to report having "no plans" for AI integration compared to smaller companies with a workforce of 51-200 employees.
 
This trend suggests that smaller, more agile companies may be the first to offer these AI-powered features to their users. They appear more willing to embrace the future of AI, potentially gaining a competitive edge in the market.
 
As we move forward, it will be interesting to observe how this landscape evolves and which companies will ultimately lead the charge in integrating AI into their software offerings.
